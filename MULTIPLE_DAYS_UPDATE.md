# Multiple Days Schedule Feature Update

## Overview
The schedule system has been updated to support multiple days per schedule, allowing teachers to create schedules that span multiple days of the week (e.g., Monday, Wednesday, Friday).

## Key Changes Made

### 1. Database Schema Update
- **Migration**: `2025_07_28_153516_add_multiple_days_to_schedules_table.php`
- **Change**: `day_of_week` column changed from `ENUM` to `JSON` to store multiple days
- **Data Migration**: Existing single-day schedules were automatically converted to JSON arrays

### 2. Model Updates
- **Schedule Model**: Added `'day_of_week' => 'array'` cast to handle JSON as array
- **Scope Methods**: Updated `scopeForDay()` to use `whereJsonContains()` for JSON queries
- **New Scope**: Added `scopeForDays()` for querying multiple days

### 3. Controller Updates
- **ScheduleController**: 
  - Updated validation to accept array of days
  - Auto-sets teacher code from session
  - Enhanced conflict detection for multiple days
- **QrCodeController**: Updated to use `whereJsonContains()` for day queries

### 4. View Updates
- **Create Form**: Changed from single select to multiple checkboxes
- **Display Views**: Updated to show multiple days as badges
- **Auto-selection**: Teacher field now auto-selects current teacher from session

## New Features

### Multiple Day Selection
Teachers can now select multiple days when creating a schedule:
- Monday, Wednesday, Friday
- Tuesday, Thursday
- Any combination of days

### Auto Teacher Assignment
- Teacher field automatically selects the current logged-in teacher
- Can still be changed if needed
- Prevents teachers from creating schedules for other teachers

### Enhanced Display
- Multiple days are displayed as colored badges
- Consistent display across all views (index, show, dashboard, QR display)

## Usage Instructions

### Creating a Schedule with Multiple Days
1. Navigate to Schedule Management → Add New Schedule
2. Teacher field will be pre-selected with current teacher
3. Select multiple days using checkboxes
4. Fill in other required fields
5. Submit the form

### Viewing Multiple Day Schedules
- Days are displayed as badges (e.g., `Monday` `Wednesday` `Friday`)
- Each day has its own badge for easy identification
- Consistent display across all schedule views

## Technical Implementation

### Database Structure
```sql
-- Before: ENUM column
day_of_week ENUM('Monday', 'Tuesday', ...)

-- After: JSON column
day_of_week JSON -- Stores: ["Monday", "Wednesday", "Friday"]
```

### Model Casting
```php
protected $casts = [
    'day_of_week' => 'array', // Automatically handles JSON ↔ Array conversion
];
```

### Query Examples
```php
// Find schedules for a specific day
Schedule::forDay('Monday')->get();

// Find schedules for multiple days
Schedule::forDays(['Monday', 'Wednesday'])->get();

// Check if schedule contains a day
Schedule::whereJsonContains('day_of_week', 'Friday')->get();
```

## Backward Compatibility
- Existing single-day schedules were automatically migrated
- All existing functionality remains intact
- Views handle both old and new data formats

## Benefits
1. **Flexibility**: Teachers can create schedules spanning multiple days
2. **Efficiency**: One schedule entry for multiple days instead of separate entries
3. **Consistency**: Unified schedule management across the application
4. **User Experience**: Auto-selection of teacher reduces data entry errors

## Testing
The system has been tested with:
- Multiple day schedule creation
- QR code generation for multi-day schedules
- Attendance tracking across multiple days
- Display consistency across all views
